# Week 1 — Expectancy, Variance & Why Win Rate Is Misleading

## Per-Trade Expectancy

The expected value of a single trade is:

```
E = p_win × avg_win + (1 − p_win) × (−avg_loss) − costs
```

A positive **E** means the strategy earns money *on average* per trade, regardless of how often it wins.

## Variance Intuition

Two strategies can share the same expectancy yet *feel* completely different.  A low-variance strategy grinds out small, consistent gains.  A high-variance strategy swings wildly — long losing streaks are normal even when E > 0.  Variance determines how much capital you need and how painful the drawdowns will be.

## Why Win Rate Is Misleading

Consider two traders:

| Parameter               | Scenario A ("Sharp-shooter") | Scenario B ("Trend-follower") |
|------------------------:|:----------------------------:|:-----------------------------:|
| Win rate                | 65 %                         | 45 %                          |
| Avg win                 | $10                          | $30                           |
| Avg loss                | $25                          | $10                           |
| **Expectancy / trade**  | **−$2.25**                   | **+$8.00**                    |

Scenario A wins *most* trades but bleeds money because the losses are disproportionately large.  Scenario B loses more often but the wins far outweigh the losses.

## Simulation Results (5 000 sims × 200 trades, seed 42)

| Metric                  | A — High WR, Negative EV | B — Lower WR, Positive EV |
|------------------------:|--------------------------:|---------------------------:|
| Expectancy / trade      | −$2.25                    | +$8.00                     |
| Variance / trade        | 278.69                    | 396.00                     |
| Mean ending equity      | $9,551                    | $11,602                    |
| Median ending equity    | $9,550                    | $11,600                    |
| Prob. of loss           | 96.72 %                   | 0.00 %                     |
| Mean max drawdown       | $550                      | $86                        |

Despite winning nearly two-thirds of the time, Scenario A ends below starting capital in **97 %** of simulations.  Scenario B, winning less than half, *never* finishes below starting capital across 5 000 runs.

## Takeaway

**Win rate is a vanity metric.**  What matters is *expectancy* — the probability-weighted average outcome per trade.  Before optimising for accuracy, check whether **p_win × avg_win** actually exceeds **(1 − p_win) × avg_loss**.  If it doesn't, a higher hit rate only delays the inevitable.
